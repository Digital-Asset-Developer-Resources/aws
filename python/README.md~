Python Scripts for Cloud Rails - AWS
------------------------------------

These python scripts require two packages:

1. [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)

   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab
   ```

2. [boto3](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/)

   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

The first package, [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), is optional, since
the Jupyter notebooks included in this repo can be also run from the
python command line or any your favorite IDE;
[Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), Idle,
[pyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) among
[others](https://realpython.com/python-ides-code-editors-guide/).


Configuration files
-------------------

[boto3](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/) requires a [credentials](credentials) file with your aws access id and key as well as the selected region.
